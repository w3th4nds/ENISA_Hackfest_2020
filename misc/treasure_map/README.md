# Treasure map :world_map:

### Description:

* We got our hand on a top secret level sanitized document. This should be our treasure map!

  PS: *The flag format is DCTF + 13 alphanumeric characters + DCTF*

### Challenge:

So, this challenge provides a `.pdf` file. This "top secret - blurred" pdf contains some garbage words at the beginning but, apart from that, we can notice that each location's coordinates, can be represented as a letter or digit. We just take all of them, one by one and check google maps to represent it as a letter/digit.
